        <p>However, it is not the only system that these insects have to defend themselves against enemies.</p>

        <p>The Phasmatodea (also known as Phasmida, Phasmatoptera or Spectra) are an order of insects whose members are variously known as stick insects, stick-bugs, walkingsticks, stick animals, or bug sticks.</p>
        <p>They are also occasionally referred to as Devil's darning needles, although this name is shared by both dragonflies and crane flies.</p>
        <p>They can be generally referred to as phasmatodeans, phasmids, or ghost insects, with phasmids in the family Phylliidae called leaf insects, leaf-bugs, walking leaves, or bug leaves.</p>

        <p>Members of the order are found on all continents except Antarctica, but they are most abundant in the tropics and subtropics.</p>
        <p>They are herbivorous, with many species living unobtrusively in the tree canopy.</p>
        <p>They have an incomplete metamorphosis life cycle with three stages: egg, nymph and adult.</p>
        <p>Many phasmids are parthenogenic, and do not require fertilized eggs for female offspring to be produced. </p>
        <p>In hotter climates, they may breed all year</p>
